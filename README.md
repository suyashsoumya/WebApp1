# WebApp1

Write a simple deliberately vulnerable web app (PHP, Python, or Java preferred) with the following functionality:

Allow users to upload a PNG, JPG, or GIF image with a caption (user can be permitted to leave caption blank)
Visitors to the site can view uploaded images, 10 per page (use next/ back links or buttons to bring them to the next 10 pictures), sorted by most recent
(Extra Credit:) allow users to sign up for an account which will allow them to edit their picture captions and delete their uploaded photos.
